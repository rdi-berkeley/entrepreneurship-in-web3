## Course Description

With the fast-evolving decentralized blockchain technology, web3 has been attracting significantly-growing attention in recent years. It provides better incentive models and control to users with powerful abstractions like smart contracts, NFTs, and DAOs that work on the distributed ledger. Replacing centralized platforms in web2 with open protocols and autonomous governance, web3 encourages community participation and has the potential to be the future of the Internet.

Web3 not only inspires cutting-edge research topics but also attracts great attention from capital markets. According to metrics reported by Forbes, “VCs deployed $30B+ globally in 2021 into crypto startups. ” and “There are 65+ crypto unicorns, with over 40 of them created in 2021. There were close to 50 crypto startups that raised over $100M in 2021.” With innovative technology breakthroughs, comes great opportunities for entrepreneurship.

Our goal in this course is to help students understand the new space of Web3 and learn about venture innovation in Web3. Through the exposure to successful entrepreneurship experience as well as remaining open challenges, we hope for our students to quickly understand the challenges and opportunities of building a startup in web3 and get hands-on experiences through the course. 

More syllabus information will be announced later.
